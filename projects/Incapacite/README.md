# Incapacité
by Maxime Perreault

Incapacité is a mixed media website programmed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It showcases a bunch of different elements created by me and a few sourced on the web (take a look at the assets readme!). There are a lot of different layers of images, gifs, 3d renders and animations, organized through the classic html document layout and on a p5.js canvas.

This interactive website is weird, vaguely threatening and inviting. It plays with the user's expectations as to what a website, a game, or more generally an interactive should be doing. The dialogs ask questions and gives the user some choices, but the effects of every buttons are not clearly associated with the answers in a logical way. Moreover, I wanted to have a progression from 'clean' to 'messy', adding more and more disrupting effects as the user interacted with the program.
