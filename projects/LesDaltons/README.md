# Les Daltons s'Ã©chappent

## Maxime Perreault

This program is inspired by the cartoon 'Lucky Luke', in which a famous and solitary cowboy runs after a group of four criminals: the Dalton brothers. These infamous criminals are ruthless, but not wise. Indeed, they keep ending up at the prison state, where they attempt to escape on a regular basis.

In this program, you control the four Dalton brothers. More specifically, you control
Joe, and the three other brothers follow Joe, just like in the cartoon.

**Your goal is to get out of the prison.** There is a narrative and a plan to follow.

_Prison break plan :_  
1- You start in your cell, with nothing to do there.  
2- You go in the yard, where there is a guard and a boulder.  
3- After talking to the guardian, you receive a pickaxe.  
4- With the pickaxe, you can break the boulder.  
5- Under the boulder is a letter from Ma Dalton (the characters' mother). It says she will be visiting them soon.  
6- Going back to the cell, you need to sleep to skip a few days until Ma is visiting.  
7- On the day of Ma's visit, you can access the visit room, where you can interact with her.  
8- She gives you bread.  
9- Going back to the cell, you can eat the bread, and then discover a spoon hidden in it.  
10- With the spoon, you can dig a tunnel in the floor of the cell.  
11- You can now escape through the tunnel.

> _here is what I wish I could have accomplished to make this program better:_  
> 1- better dialogues and UI to display it.  
> 2- multiple choices of interactions (or even multiple possible escape plans?).  
> 3- more and better suited sound effects.  
> 4- add different personalities or unique behaviors for each brother.
