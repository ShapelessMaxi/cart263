    <h2>TOP SECRET DO NOTe READE</h2>
    <p>
      Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, <span class="top-secret redacted">a Latin professor</span> at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
      looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, <span class="top-secret redacted">discovered the undoubtable source</span>. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of
      <span class="top-secret redacted">"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"</span> (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the <span class="top-secret redacted">Renaissance.</span> The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
      comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
    </p>
    <p>
      The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the <span class="top-secret redacted">1500s</span> is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact <span class="top-secret redacted">original</span> form, accompanied by
      English
      versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where can I get some?
      There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly</span> believable. If you are going to use a passage of
      Lorem
      <span class="top-secret redacted">Ipsum, you need to be sure</span> there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined <span class="top-secret redacted">chunks</span> as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It
      uses
      a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence <span class="top-secret redacted">structures</span>, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The <span class="top-secret redacted">generated</span> Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
      non-characteristic
      words etc.
